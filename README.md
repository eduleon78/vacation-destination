Advanced Distance Converter, Using JavaScript to Convert Distances. In this project, we're going to use an extension to what we did in the earlier project 
for the distance converter. We're just going to add an additional feature. What that additional feature is, it'll convert miles to kilometers, where we can 
press the "K" key to convert kilometers to miles, or we can press the "M" key to go back. We can go back and forth between doing different types of conversions.
